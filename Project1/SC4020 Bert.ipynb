It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.\\n \\n But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by \\\"military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values\\\" he added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most \\\"pressing political challenge\\\" of the present day, Mr Blair warned. The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to \\\"build anew their alliance\\\".\\n \\n \\\"All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. It is urgent that we do so.\\\" Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election \\\"a true celebration of American democracy\\\". The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his \\\"warmest congratulations\\\", saying: \\\"We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.\\\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.\\n \\n Mr Bush's first task was to \\\"rebuild a sense of domestic purpose\\\" within the US, he said. Mr Kennedy said: \\\"Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.\\\" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an \\\"umbilical cord\\\" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.\\n \\n \\\"Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. \\\"Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.\\\" Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.\\n \\n Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news. But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change. He claimed the US was the only country with independent scientists.\\n\",\n          \"China Aviation seeks rescue deal\\n \\n Scandal-hit jet fuel supplier China Aviation Oil has offered to repay its creditors $220m (\\u00c2\\u00a3117m) of the $550m it lost on trading in oil futures.\\n \\n The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.\\n \\n Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares. It cut its holding from 75% to 60% on 20 October.\\n\",\n          \"Yukos heading back to US courts\\n \\n Russian oil and gas company Yukos is due in a US court on Thursday as it continues to fight for its survival.\\n \\n The firm is in the process of being broken up by Russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (\\u00c2\\u00a314bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted.\\n \\n Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions, including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank, which is also an advisor to Gazprom, has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection.\\n \\n Lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank's business position, analysts said.\\n \\n Analysts are not optimistic about Yukos' chances in court. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings. On top of that, the firm only has limited assets in the US. Yukos has won small victories, however, and is bullish about its chances in court. \\\"Do we have an ability to influence what happens? We think we do,\\\" said Mike Lake, a Yukos spokesman. \\\"The litigation risks are real,\\\" said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          4,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
